# FlaskAPI Pet Store
 Pet shop example API

 See https://petstore3.swagger.io/ for API details.


## Running the API Server
 Need to install flask using pip:
 ```
 pip install flask
 ```
 As well as flask-restful:
 ```
 pip install flask-restful
 ```
 Now execute the following commands to start the server in a shell:
 ```
 export FLASK_APP=main
 flask run
 ```
 Now the API server is running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/
 
 ## Running the Client
 To run the client just run the test.py file (or a custom file if you want) using python3!
